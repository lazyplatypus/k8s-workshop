<Intro>

Prometheus is one of many open-source projects managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It is monitoring software that integrates with a wide range of systems natively or through the use of plugins. It is considered the default monitoring solution for the popular Kubernetes container orchestration engine, another CNCF hosted project.

Prometheus can collect metrics about your application and infrastructure.  Metrics are small concise descriptions of an event: date, time, and a descriptive value. While prometheus does store or `log` metrics, metrics should not be confused with logs, which can include reams of data.  Rather than gathering a great deal of data about one thing, Prometheus uses the approach of gathering a little bit of data about many things to help you understand the state and trajectory of your system. It has become very popular in the industry because it has many powerful features for monitoring metrics and providing alerts that can, with orchestration systems (e.g. Kubernetes), automate responses to changing conditions.
