New Relic's On-Host Integrations use [Kubernetes service auto-discovery](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-discovery-kubernetes) to identify available 3rd party services running in the cluster.  All supported OHIs are shipped with the New Relic Infrastructure agent in a Kubernetes cluster.  All you need to do is provided a valid configuration when you install the `newrelic-infrastructure` subchart.

## Enabling the NGINX OHI

In the `values.yaml` file found in this directory, you'll see a section of the config called `newrelic-infrastructure`.  Any configuration options defined in this section are passed down to the the `newrelic-infrastructure` subchart from `nri-bundle`.  Uncomment the `newrelic-infrastructure` section and everything nested underneath it.

A few things to call out:
* `name` - this is the integration file name that will reside in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d` inside each New Relic Infrastructure container.
* `nri-discovery-kubernetes` - this is used to auto-discover the services in the cluster matching the label `app: nginx`.
* `integrations` - this is where you configure the integration details.  Note that the variable `${discovery.ip}` is used in the NGINX status page URL.  This is dynamic for every instance that matches the `app: nginx` label.

```yaml
newrelic-infrastructure:
  integrations_config:
    - name: nri-nginx.yaml
      data:
        discovery:
          command:
            # Use the following optional arguments:
            # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on
            # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection
            # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255
            exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes
            match:
              label.app: nginx
        integrations:
          - name: nri-nginx
            env:
              # If you're using ngx_http_api_module be certain to use the full path up to and including the version number
              # Use the discovered IP as the host address
              STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/nginx_status
              # Name of Nginx status module OHI is to query against. discover | ngx_http_stub_status_module | ngx_http_status_module | ngx_http_api_module
